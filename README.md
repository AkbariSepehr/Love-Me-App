# Love-Me-App

Here we are again; another useless java application which is fun to make :)

The main (and only) purpose of this app is to ask you if a question "Do you love me?" and not let you to respond NO with chaning the place of the NO button in a loop... until you press YES.

As always, I encourage you to download the code, and maybe not better, but have fun with this...app?
